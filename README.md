# Sportseye
Computer Vision Project for detecting and tracking objects (sports)

The aim of this project is to develop and deploy AI software deployed on a drone to enable it to automatically record football matches using Computer vision.

The intial software has been developed using a generic YOLOv3 object detection algorithm and this has been integrated with multiple object tracking algorithms such as GOTURN, CRST, MOSSE etc.

A custom faster R-CNN model has been trained using Tensorflow and a custome dataset to detect footballs for the initlal application
